Privacy Policy for Home Classroom Integration

Effective Date: December 9, 2024

Hey there! Thanks for using the Home Classroom Integration for Home Assistant. This privacy policy explains what information we collect when you use this integration and how we handle it. Since this is an open-source project, I want to be transparent with you about your data.
What Data Do We Collect?

    OAuth2 Authentication Info: When you sign in with your Google account, the integration asks for permission to access your Google Classroom data, like your assignments and homework. We only use this data to show you updates on your assignments.
    Assignment Data: We pull information like the name of your assignments, their due dates, and their status so we can notify you when things are due or updated.

How Do We Use Your Data?

    We use your data to connect to Google Classroom and show you your assignments and homework updates directly in Home Assistant.
    We don’t store any personal information. The integration only pulls the data when needed (like fetching your latest assignments) and doesn’t keep anything on a server.

How We Keep Your Data Safe

    Your data is transmitted through secure connections, and we follow standard practices to keep it safe. But since we’re using Google’s OAuth2 for authentication, we don’t have full control over how Google handles the data.
    We don’t sell or share your data with anyone, and we won’t do so in the future.

Your Rights

    You can revoke access to your Google account at any time by going to your Google account settings and managing app permissions. That’ll stop the integration from accessing your Google Classroom data.
