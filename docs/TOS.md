Terms of Service for Home Classroom Integration

Effective Date: December 9, 2024

Welcome to the Home Classroom Integration! By using this integration with Home Assistant, you’re agreeing to these terms. They outline the rules for using the integration, so please read through them.
What This Integration Does

This integration allows you to connect Google Classroom with Home Assistant, so you can get updates about your homework and assignments directly in Home Assistant. It helps you track deadlines and stay on top of your work.
What You Can Do

    You can use the integration to view assignments from your Google Classroom account.
    You can set it up to get notifications about upcoming assignments.

What You Can’t Do

    You can’t use the integration to scrape or collect personal data in any way other than for displaying homework and assignments.
    Don’t try to modify or reverse-engineer the integration without permission. This is an open-source project, and I’m happy to accept contributions if they’re in line with the project goals.

Limitations

    I can’t guarantee that this integration will always work perfectly. There might be bugs, or Google might make changes to its API that could affect functionality.
    I’m not responsible for any data loss or issues that happen from using this integration.

Termination

If you ever decide you don’t want to use this integration, just revoke access from your Google account. I won’t hold onto any of your data.
Changes to These Terms

Since this is an open-source project, I might update the terms occasionally. You’ll always have access to the latest version on the GitHub page.
